# Gradle Version Catalogs IntelliJ Plugin

### Forked from [gradle-version-catalogs-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/F43nd1r/gradle-version-catalogs-intellij-plugin)

- Added support for custom TOML files
- Added support for `build.gradle` files

---

Improved gradle version catalog support including

- jump to usage/definition from/to versions.toml and build.gradle.kts
- detect unused declarations
- versions.toml autocompletion

# Note on Future Development

Android Studio is already rolling out [builtin support for Version Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#gradle-version-catalogs). This plugin will be
discontinued once IntelliJ IDEA gets those features as well.
